    <h1><u>Introduction</u></h1>
     <p>Hello, welcome to my website.I'll start off by introducing myself, my name is 
       Jose Ramirez and this is a website I build to show off my achievement and see if 
       I can caught your interest. I design this web page in sections, the first, which is this one you are on, is the introduction, 
       then the second is talking about myself and my abilities, and in the final section are ways to contact me.
     </p>

    <h1><u>About Me</u></h1>
    <p>I started coding in 2012 and been coding ever since. When I was beginning, I took a web design class in high school, my 9th grade.
      Mr.Chagoyan, my teacher at that time, was teaching html and css on notepad ++ and then we move on from notepad to use dreamweaver.
      After finishing my first web design class I took a second and pretty much
        we used the same html and css but we focus more on design rather than code. And in my final year of high school
      I took a class on computer program which taught java and javascript. After that I took some CIS classes in college which 
      provide more information on html and css. I took that class for one semester, which is half a year, then I took the second part
      which was more css and html but a little more difficult. </p>
       <p> There was four parts to that class but I only took 2 then I began focusing 
      in a BitWise program that the school was providing. From the program I gain knowledge on html,css, javascript, jQuery,
    bootstrap and angular 2. Sooner or later, I will have knowledge on wordpress. I also continue to study on my own since 
  there is so much code to learn from. Below there are some links to my projects.. </p>

  <div id="section3" class="container-fluid">
    <h1><u>Contact</u></h1>
    <p>To contact me, I am usually on my gmail or slack so that would be the best way to contact me.
      but I will provide other source if these are inconvenient.
